  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> June 3, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Tundratic Labs LLC ("Company", "we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our app, <strong>Friend Group Leader</strong> ("Service").</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>User-Uploaded Photos:</strong><br />
  Our app allows users to upload images containing groups of people. These photos are temporarily stored on our servers to generate shareable URLs that allow users to view or share their results. We do not associate these images with personally identifiable information.</p>

  <p>By uploading a photo, you confirm that all individuals in the photo have given their consent for the image to be uploaded and processed by our service.</p>

  <p><strong>Device Data:</strong><br />
  We may collect basic diagnostic data such as device type and crash reports to improve app stability. No personally identifiable information is tied to this data.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide core features of the Friend Group Leader app</li>
    <li>To generate and serve shareable links for photo results</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and troubleshoot issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Uploaded photos are retained only as long as needed to generate and serve shareable results. After that, they may be deleted from our servers. Diagnostic and crash data may be retained to improve future updates to the app.</p>

  <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has used our app and submitted personal data, please contact us immediately and we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
