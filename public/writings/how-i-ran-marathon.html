            <h1>How I ran the New York City marathon with 7 weeks of (sort-of) real training</h1>
            <h2>6/20/2024</h2>

                I started real training on Sunday, September 17th, and the race was Sunday, November 5th. On the 17th, I reached a breaking point with how far behind in training I was. Up until then, my training consisted of 1 or 2 runs a week. Tops. Never went over 5 miles, and most were about 3. If I even ran that week. With a 26 mile race weeks away, that Sunday I finally woke up.
<br><br>
I would have loved to be more consistent about training, but every time I ran, I got the same blister on my right foot that I’d have to wait 4 days to run again. I tried all sorts of solutions like special running socks, non-sweat foot deodorant — to no avail. 
<br><br>
Finally, on the 17th, three pivotal things happened. My mom was in town and she asked how training was going. I lied and said it was going great, which, when said to her face, was a huge reality check when I realized then that she was about to see me embarrass myself in a matter of weeks. So, the mental ball started rolling. Then, I went to the running store and got what finally stopped the blisters: foot tape. I got the foot tape originally for the reason that if I was gonna get blisters, at least covering them up would prevent me from a real injury like an infection. Third: David Goggins.
<br><br>
Before going for my run, something came across my social media that I look back upon as the biggest mindset shifter for my pre-race training. Pretty funny it came from social media which I hate and no longer use. Anyway, what I saw, and what pretty much is the answer to my clickbait-y title, is a story of Goggins that I’d seen before, yet on that Sunday, it actually meant something more than your average “hell yeah” inspiration typically seen and not thought of again. 
<br><br>
He told the story of the time he ran 100 miles in one day. With no running training.
<br><br>
So here I was, knowing full well that the running training I’d done so far, while minimal, without a doubt had me in better running shape than David Goggins was, the day when he ran his 100. And that meant to me that I could run 100 miles *the next day* if I wanted to. Sure, his mental toughness capacities would have put mine to shame, but for the first time, I realized that my poor training didn’t matter — the marathon was physically possible no matter what. What a mindset shift.
<br><br>
I tried to keep writing to make a big arc out of the rest of my training — make it some sound like some elaborate story of triumph and glory, where I overcame insane odds. But, to the people reading this that I’d imagine are most interested right now — marathon procrastinators/people who want to know the “secret” behind my title — it was simple. Not easy by any means, but simple.
<br><br>
That Sunday the 17th, 7 weeks away from the 26.2 mile run, my motivation pushed me to decide to run 6 miles instead of my planned 3. Then, mid-run, my foot hadn’t blistered yet and didn’t feel like it was going to, so the wind really filled my sails and I decided to go for 12<sup><a href="#foot-1" style="color: grey">[1]</a></sup>. I don’t know if it was the perfect weather, or the effect of some powerful motivation forces in the air, but that turned into my favorite run of all time. Finally certain that it was possible to run the 26 miles took a huge weight off my shoulders, as until then, I had such a deep anxiety that my poor training would lead to an incomplete race.
<br><br>
My training after that, like I said two paragraphs ago and as I’ll elaborate upon here, was hard but simple. An extra loop — aka four miles — every Sunday, as well as at least one other run of any distance during the week. So, a typical week was me procrastinating my run until finally Thursday would roll around and I’d tell myself I’d do a loop (but usually cut it short at 3). However, I was great about the Sundays. And by that, I mean I ran an extra loop the next week, making it a 16 mile run, and then the next week added a loop and hit 20, then decided it was time to taper. 16 was the hardest run of my life. By the time I’d finished my third loop/12th mile, it wasn’t pain but complete exhaustion that forced my body to run, if I honestly had to guess, 2 miles per hour faster than walking. Then the next week, 20 became the *new* hardest run of my life, but something interesting happened: I hit the wall of exhaustion at mile 16 instead of the previous week’s marker mile 12. Nice! In theory, I could be coasting until the 96 mile mark by February.
<br><br>
However, this optimistic conjecture didn’t come to mind until just now — many months later. At the time, my thoughts around mile 18 on that first 20 mile run was deep anxiety again. My snail pace had me thinking that I would be so slow, the racemakers would cut me off and I’d be kicked out of the race. Then a few days later I saw a video of a lady who walked the entire marathon the year prior. Funny stories that anxiety will come up with.
<br><br>
Once I hit 20 on September 31st, I was five weeks away and heard not to go over twenty, so each Sunday after that I went down until the week prior, where I ran 8 and was feeling like a million bucks.
<br><br>
Race day was awesome. The entirety of New York City was out and about cheering everyone on. I ran at a faster pace than I’d ever run for a sustained bout, probably about 8 minutes a mile for the first 16 miles. I walked about a quarter mile at the halfway point because Casey Neistat said to take a break there, but got bored and kept going. However, “the wall” people say you hit at mile 20 hit me at 16, making for an extra-grueling last ten. 
<br><br>
I wish it wasn’t as hard as it was and I had a little more fun during those last ten because at one point a guy in Harlem was blasting Reggaeton and giving out free Fireball shots, and not stopping to take one is something I’ll always regret. However thinking back on it, while undoubtedly an insanely cool thing to say I did, I would have thrown it up on the spot, making me even more dehydrated and bringing matters from terrible to even more terrible.
<br><br>
But eventually, after 10 miles of losing my mind seeing people sprint past me (like big whoop), I crossed the finish line with a 4:12 time. Finally done. Or so I thought. IYKYK.
<br><br>
<span id="foot-1" style="color: blue;">[1]</span>: I run on a 3 mile loop, but taking a quick turn can make it a 4 mile loop. So, it was a little easier mentally to just say, hell, I’m gonna go for three full loops instead of just 1 and a half. When tired during running, mustering up the guts to just say I’m turning left instead of right was all it took to run an extra loop instead of calling it quits, because it would take too much energy to stop my momentum and turn around. Here’s a visualization of the map so you get the point where I would turn off or not:
