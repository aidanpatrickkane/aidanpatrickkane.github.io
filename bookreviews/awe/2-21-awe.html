    <p>Awe by Dacher Keltner gets the prestigious title of being my first ever official personal website post*1. I chose this book because it provides me information on what I can do to effectively provide awesome content to people in the form of my dream project of making something that people look at once a day, feeling amazed/inspired/a better sense that the world is a place of good. Right away, it became clear that it’s exactly what I should be reading right now*2 when I read that studies have shown that a few minutes a day of awe is as good for you as “pretty much anything there is.” I take this pretty seriously as the writer is a UC Berkeley Psychology professor who, as a result, has a deep network of people just about as knowledgeable on things that are good for you as anyone. That fact about daily awe reinforced my excitement that the idea of providing a platform for daily awe really was worth doing. Maybe I’ll be able to get his consul some day on how I can improve my app. Hell, he might even be on the board of directors. Anyway, at this point I should probably provide Dr. Keltner’s definition of awe so that we can all be on level ground when I discuss it throughout my review on the book. But I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to because I don’t have to. We all know what awe is, and if asked like I am asking you right now, can certainly think back to a moment of profound awe pretty quickly. It’s one of the most impactful feelings we can ever have and seriously shifts our understanding of the world. If I can be someone who is behind an app or platform or whatever it’ll be called when it’s pumping some serious value into the “The world rules” industry, I’ll know I’ve made myself into someone I knew I always could and should be. Learning technical skills has gotten me down the path of comparing myself to geniuses, as the field of computer science is jam packed with smart people, but the fact of the matter is that while they’re smart, the vast majority don’t really know what they want to do with their knowledge. Realistically, I could probably build this app if I had three to four days of free time – obviously not as good as it ultimately will be – I just need the database of actual content now. It’s in my brain already, but I need to start collecting content and then posting it and then finding out a way to personalize it to people so that they enter a positive feedback loop of seeing a post of content (again only one post because social media addiction kills the whole point), loving it so much that they have a good next few hours, then as a result, get excited for the next morning, thus pretty much making them excited for the future all the time. If I can manage to make people excited for the future all the time in a healthy manner without them becoming dependent probably*3 that’s the best I can really do with the resources I’ve been given in this life. Or maybe I inspire a lot of people to start writing because I’m sure as I write more on here I’ll have a dedicated post to the importance of writing because God it is so impactful. Or maybe I’ll just get enough people to start listening to Huberman and Lex that health (rabbi) and deep talks (Dr. F) become much more appreciated, making people start using that positive input to produce positive output, through how they treat others or their attitudes or whatever it may be. I really didn’t end up writing about the awe book too much, and I’ve gotta go to sleep since it’s 12:13, I’ve gotta publish this online, then wake up at 6 for the gym and I’m too tired to keep writing. This was fun though. Aidanpkane out.

    <em>Footnotes</em>
    1: Official I say as I unofficially made a personal website last summer but hosted it on wordpress which was cheating – I don’t take handouts. It also sucked and I was trying to make something special out of it and also couldn’t write back then. However, sucking is a natural precedent to being good. And I’m sure I still suck now, which is clear through my four sentence footnote – I digress.
    <br>
    2: Probably. If I read the Bible, I’d assume that could have an inestimably large impact on me, as would any other book I couldn’t even imagine right now.
    <br>
    3: Hopefully my app will incite people to action through like seeing good poetry and writing good poetry or seeing a beautiful mountain and deciding to get into hiking
